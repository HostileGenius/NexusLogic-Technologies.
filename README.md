Internships Tasks
This was the first task of my one month internship at NexusLogic Technologies. First task assigned to me was to create a landing page. A Landing Page is a standalone web page
created for a specific marketing or promotional campaign, often linked from search engine
marketing, email, or social media ads. It's designed to drive visitors toward a single callto-action (CTA), such as signing up for a service, downloading an ebook, or purchasing a product. Landing Pages are tailored to increase conversions and typically contain compelling content, eye-catching visuals, and minimal distractions.
